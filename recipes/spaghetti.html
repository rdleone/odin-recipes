    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Easy Spaghetti Recipe is ready in just 15 minutes and is a hearty, 
        comforting meal during cooler months. Pair with a side salad or steamed 
        veggies for a full meal and enjoy!
    </p>
    <p>If you have extra time on your hands, feel free to sauté a little onion, 
        garlic, or diced bell pepper with the ground beef. I like the flavor these 
        extra ingredients add, but they’re not necessary to make a really great, 
        simple spaghetti. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>one 12-oz box <strong>Barilla® Pronto® Half-Cut Spaghetti</strong></li>
        <li>1 tsp <strong>salt</strong>, optional to taste</li>
        <li>1 lb <strong>ground beef</strong></li>
        <li>one 24-oz jar <strong>Barilla® Tomato and Basil Sauce</strong></li>
        <li>finely chopped <strong>fresh basil</strong>, optional</li>
        <li>freshly grated <strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a large pan, add the pasta, cover with 3 cups cold water, optional salt to taste, and boil over high heat until water has absorbed, about 10 minutes, but watch your pasta and cook as needed until al dente. While pasta boils, brown the ground beef.</li>
        <li>To a large skillet, add the ground beef and cook over medium-high heat, breaking up the meat with a spatula as it cooks to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>After beef has cooked through, add the pasta sauce, stir to combine, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until heated through.</li>
        <li>After pasta has cooked for about 10 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed, add the sauce over the pasta and toss to combine in the skillet or alternatively plate the pasta and add sauce to each individual plate as desired.</li>
        <li>Optionally garnish with basil and Parmesan to taste and serve immediately. Pasta and sauce are best warm and fresh but extra will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
