    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A big bowl of piping hot chili topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, and Fritos 
        is one of my ultimate cold-weather comfort foods. It’s something that I’ve loved 
        since I was a kid, and I still can’t get enough of it.
    </p>
    <p>While I’ve tried quite a few classic chili recipes, I still hadn’t managed to find
        “the one” until I came across this one long ago. Once I made this recipe, the 
        search was officially over; it is, hands-down, the best chili recipe I’ve ever 
        made. It is worthy of lamination and a permanent home in any recipe collection.
